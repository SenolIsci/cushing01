# Machine Learning Approach for Diagnosis of Rare Diseases: Study of Cushing’s Syndrome Using Retrospective Medical Records

## Abstract

Accurate identification of a rare disease plays a critical role in providing early and correct diagnosis that may facilitate treatment and improve patient outcomes. Cushing’s Syndrome (CS) is a potentially lethal and rare disorder caused by abnormally high levels of cortisol hormone. Diagnosis of CS is a complex process, which requires careful and concurrent interpretation of signs and symptoms, multiple biochemical test results, and findings of medical imaging by physicians with a high degree of specialty and knowledge to make correct judgments. In this article, we explore the state of the art machine learning algorithms to demonstrate their potential to analyze and classify CS in order to facilitate the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.  Prominent algorithms are compared using nested cross-validation and various class comparison strategies including multiclass, one vs. all, and one vs. one binary classification. Our findings show that Random Forest (RF) algorithm is most suitable for the classification of CS. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can classify CS subjects with an average accuracy of 92% and an average F1 score of 91.5%, depending on the class comparison strategy and selected features.
